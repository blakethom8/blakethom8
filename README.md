## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Provider Intelligence Platform](https://github.com/blakethom8/provider-search) • [Live Demo →](http://mydoclist.com)

Building an intelligence layer across healthcare data assets — integrating CMS public datasets (90M+ rows), Google Places, and NPPES to power provider search and relationship intelligence for physician liaison teams.

**What it does:** Reduces provider search time from 15-20 minutes to <30 seconds. Real-time search, contact enrichment, Medicare utilization analysis, and quality scores.

**Tech:** Python • FastAPI • React • DuckDB • Supabase • Docker • Claude API

**Key features:**
- Entity resolution matching providers across disparate datasets (62% accuracy)
- Analytics dashboard with usage tracking and search pattern analysis
- LLM-powered provider matching for ambiguous cases
- Composite scoring models (prescribing patterns + quality metrics + network relationships)

### CMS Healthcare Data Pipeline *(Coming soon)*

Infrastructure project ingesting 10+ CMS public datasets (NPPES, Medicare utilization, Open Payments, MIPS) into a unified data warehouse supporting multiple downstream applications.

**Tech:** Python • DuckDB • SQL • Data Engineering
